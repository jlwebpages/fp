<b><u>General Rules</u>:</b>

<ol class="dark_blue_color">

<li>
If a player plays in the Regular Season, then he/she must also play in the Post Season.
<p>
</li>

<li>
If a player quits at any time before the end of the Post Season, that player still has to pay and is subject to being excluded from the Football Pool in the future.
<p>
</li>

<li>
Money isn't collected from or paid out to any player until the end of the Post Season.
<p>
</li>

</ol>

<b><u>Regular Season Rules</u>:</b>

<ol class="dark_blue_color">

<li>
The cost for each player is <b><font class="green_color">$3</font></b> per week.
<p>
</li>

<li>
Each week, you have to pick the winner (<b><font class="red_color">H</font></b>ome or <b><font class="red_color">V</font></b>isitor) of each game.  Then, you have to assign a weight to each game.  Start by assigning a weight of <b><font class="red_color">16</font></b> to the game that you have the most confidence in.  Then, assign a weight of <b><font class="red_color">15</font></b> to the game that you have the next most confidence in and so on, until you've assigned a weight to every game.  Finally, you have to predict the total points of the Monday Night game.  If needed, this will be used as a tiebreaker.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b><u>NOTE</u></b>:&nbsp&nbspIf more than one Monday Night game is scheduled, or if no Monday Night game is scheduled, then the total points prediction is for the last game listed on the Input Form which contains the schedule for the week.
<p>
</dt>
</dl>
</li>

<li>
Each week, the player with the highest score wins <b><font class="green_color">$31</font></b>.  Scores are calculated by adding up the weights of each player's winning picks (a game ending in a tie counts as a loss).  If two or more players tie, then their total points predications will be used to break the tie.  The player who comes closest to the actual Monday Night total points wins.  If this turns out to be a tie, then the player whose prediction is less than the actual Monday Night total points wins.
<p>
</li>

<li>
At the end of the Regular Season, the player with the highest average score wins <b><font class="green_color">$51</font></b>.  The player with the second highest average score wins <b><font class="green_color">$34</font></b>.  Each player's low score is thrown out of the average score calculation.
<p>
</li>

<li>
Each week, you need to submit your picks by <b><font class="red_color">Saturday morning at 6:00 AM</font></b>. If there's a Thursday Night game, then you need to submit your picks by <b><font class="red_color">Wednesday night at 8:00 PM</font></b>. If you don't submit your picks on time, you'll receive a score of "<b><font class="red_color">0</font></b>" and you still have to pay.
<p>
</li>

</ol>

<b><u>Post Season Rules</u>:</b>

<ol class="dark_blue_color">

<li>
The cost for each player is <b><font class="green_color">$10</font></b>.
<p>
</li>

<li>
Each week you have to pick the winner (<b><font class="red_color">H</font></b>ome or <b><font class="red_color">V</font></b>isitor) and predict the margin of victory of each game.  You also have to predict the total points of the last game scheduled. If needed, this will be used as a tiebreaker.
<p>
</li>

<li>
Each week, the player with the lowest score wins <b><font class="green_color">$10</font></b>.  Scores are calculated by adding up the absolute values of the difference between the predicted margin of victory and the actual margin of victory of each game.  A penalty of 7 points will also be applied for each incorrect pick.  If two or more players tie, then their total points predications will be used to break the tie.  The player who comes closest to the actual total points wins.
<p>
</li>

<li>
Scores for the Conference Championships (Week 3) are multiplied by 2 and scores for the Super Bowl (Week 4) are multiplied by 4 to make the impact these weeks equal to the first two weeks.
<p>
</li>

<li>
At the end of the Post Season, the player with the lowest overall combined score wins <b><font class="green_color">$60</font></b>.  Any ties split the <b><font class="green_color">$60</font></b>.  The player with the second lowest overall combined score wins <b><font class="green_color">$20</font></b>.  Any ties split the <b><font class="green_color">$20</font></b>.
<p>
</li>

<li>
Each week, you need to submit your picks by <b><font class="red_color">Saturday morning at 6:00 AM</font></b>.  If you don't submit your picks on time, you'll receive a blank score and you'll be out of the running for the best overall combined score.
<p>
</li>

</ol>

<b><u>Tips</u>:</b>

<ol class="dark_blue_color">

<li>
If you don't submit your picks on time and the Football Pool website hasn't been updated yet, then you <i><b><font class="red_color">might</font></b></i> still have a chance to get your picks in.  However, once the Football Pool website's been updated, all bets are off!
